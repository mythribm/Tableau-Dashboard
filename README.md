Project title: HR Analytics Dashboard — Attrition & Retention Insights
Tools: Tableau,Excel
Dataset: Internal HR dataset — 1,470 employee records, ~39 columns (demographics, job role, department, age, gender, education field, job satisfaction, income, tenure, attrition flag, etc.)

Objective:
Identify patterns and drivers of employee attrition and surface targeted retention opportunities for HR and business leaders.

Key metrics & findings (numbers pulled from cleaned data / dashboard):
-Total employees: 1,470
-Attrition count: 237 (Attrition rate ≈ 16.12%)
-Active/current employees: 1,233
-Average employee age: 37

Top takeaways:
1.Departments with highest attrition: R&D (133; 56% of attritions), Sales (92; 39%), HR (12). R&D is the largest contributor to overall attrition and should be prioritized.
2.Attrition by gender: Male = 150, Female = 87 → males represent a larger share of leavers in this dataset.
3.Age distribution: Peak employee population is between 28–36 years; this cohort also shows meaningful attrition and deserves targeted retention efforts.
4.Education fields with the highest attrition: Life Sciences (89), Medical (63), Marketing (35), Technical Degree (32) — hire/retention strategies should be tuned by education background.
5.Job satisfaction heatmap: Sales Executive, Research Scientist and Laboratory Technician are among the largest role cohorts with mixed satisfaction levels opportunities to lift satisfaction in those groups could reduce churn.

Visuals included on the dashboard:
-KPI banner (Employee Count, Attrition Rate, Avg Age, Active Employees)
-Pie chart for Department-wise attrition
-Age histogram (employees by fine-grained age bins)
-Heatmap of Job Role vs Job Satisfaction (counts)
-Horizontal bar for Attrition count by Education Field
-Donut/cohort charts showing Attrition counts by age-group & gender

Impact:
The dashboard enables HR leaders to quickly identify high-risk functions, cohorts and educational backgrounds, allowing them to prioritize retention interventions (compensation review, career-path planning, targeted training or stay interviews) where they will reduce churn most efficiently.
